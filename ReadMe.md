# Proton-VPN-Custom-Script

A custom bash script i used to quickly connect and disconnect from proton vpn using the cli.

## Usage
- `pvpn-custom -f` to connect to the fastest server.
- `pvpn-custom -r` to connect to the most reliable server.
- `pvpn-custom -d` to disconnect and deactivate the kill switch.
